"""Mechanical fixes applied to the fetched Eclipse, BetterSunshineEngine and
SunshineHeaderInterface sources before the port compiles them (nothing of
theirs is kept in this repository). Each entry: a glob under the source root,
a regular expression and its replacement, and why. Entries with the same why
form a group, which must match at least once (unless marked OPTIONAL), so an
upstream change that makes a rule miss stops the build instead of passing
silently. The sources are reset to their checkouts first, then fixed up and
patched (shi-layout.patch, mods-port.patch); a marker records the state, so
an unchanged checkout is not redone.
