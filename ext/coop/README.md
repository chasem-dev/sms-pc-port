# Split-screen co-op

Two players in one game on one computer, each with their own camera and half of the screen.
SMS Launcher starts it with **Play co-op**, under ▾ beside Play; without the launcher, `SMS_COOP=1` does.

- The first player plays as ever, on the keyboard and mouse or a controller.
- A second player joins any time a level is being played by pressing **Start on another controller**: they appear beside Mario as Luigi (Mario's model in Luigi's green), with FLUDD, and the screen splits in two.
  Holding Start for 1.5 seconds leaves; a short press of their Start is the pause menu, as the first player's is. Unplugging their controller leaves too.
- As a level starts, a notice says how to join: "press START on another controller" when one is connected (pressed yet or not), else, once a game, "connect a second controller".
- Which controller is "another": with the keyboard and mouse in hand (they were used last), any controller's Start joins; with a controller in hand, another controller's does. The first player's own controller always pauses, so a player alone with one controller never joins by accident, and plain Play (no `SMS_COOP`) never takes a second player at all.
  While a level is played, the first player's controller stays theirs as long as they play with it (a few seconds of nothing from it, and the controller used last is theirs): so the second player trying their stick before pressing Start (which moves Mario, since every controller but player 2's is the first player's) still joins with that Start.
  A Start pressed on two controllers at once never joins: that is one controller seen twice (DS4Windows, BetterJoy or Steam Input beside the controller itself), and it pauses as the first player's. The log names each controller as it connects.
  A GameCube adapter's ports are controllers of their own: the second port with a controller in it joins the same way.
- Whatever either player collects counts for both, as in multiplayer: coins (every 50 a life for both), red and blue coins, 1-Ups, the 100-coin Shine and Shines are the game's own counts. A Shine the second player touches is theirs: the Shine Get plays full screen around them, and the save prompt follows. Hearts, fruit and water bottles fill the health or FLUDD of whoever took them, and a nozzle box gives its nozzle to their FLUDD. Lives are shared too: the second player losing a life (an enemy, a pit) takes one from the shared count, the HUD's, which shows it, and they are back beside Mario three seconds later. Lost on the last one (×00), the death plays and they leave the screen: Mario carries on alone, and the next life that comes (a 1-Up, 50 coins) is theirs and brings them back. Mario losing his last life is the game over as ever. (Falling out of the world, or being left far behind, puts them back beside Mario at once, with no life lost.)
- Enemies go after whoever is nearer: each object that moves near the second player moves as if they were Mario (`objectMove`). Either player can talk to people and read signs, take pipes and paintings (everyone goes), and get Shines.
- The screen is split while both play the level. Cutscenes, a Shine Get and other moments the game shows on its own camera are full screen, on the first player's camera, as is everything while the second player is out.
- `SMS_COOP_SPLIT=stacked` puts the views one above the other (the first player's on top); by default they are side by side (the first player's on the left). The launcher's Settings → Display has it as **Co-op split screen**.
- Save states are off while two play. Co-op is off in multiplayer games (`SMS_MULTIPLAYER`).

## How it works

[`game/coop.cpp`](game/coop.cpp), with the input in [`platform/pad/pad.cpp`](../../platform/pad/pad.cpp) and the views in [`platform/gx`](../../platform/gx/src/gx_render.cpp).

**Controller 2.** The port used to put every controller into controller 1. It now keeps each SDL controller's state apart (by its instance id), puts together all but the second player's for controller 1, and gives the second player's its own `PADStatus` on channel 1, which the game reads as it reads channel 1 on a GameCube. `port_coop_*` tell the game who joined and left. Mouse look stays the first player's camera's (`port_camera_take_mouse` gives the second camera nothing).

**Player 2** is a second `TMario` (`TCoopMario`), made from the stage's own Mario record (the one the loader read, kept by `zzzzz-ext-20`) while the stage loads (the `sceneLoaded` hook, before the stage lets its parameter files go), so they have Mario's parameters, models and FLUDD. They go in the player group (`プレーヤーグループ`), beside Mario, so the stage moves, animates, hits and draws them with him; until someone joins they do nothing and touch nothing. The game already runs other `TMario`s than Mario (Shadow Mario, Il Piantissimo): the Mario code works on `this`, and reaches "the player" through `gpMarioOriginal`, `gpMarioAddress` and the access globals (`gpMarioPos`, `SMS_SetMarioAccessParams`). While player 2 runs (their move, their camera's, their view's drawing), those globals are theirs, and so are `gpCamera` and the camera's helpers (`gpCameraShake`, `gpCameraMario`, `gpCameraOption`), so the game's own code plays them as it plays Mario. Both players' surroundings are in play, as each player's own game is in multiplayer: the stage's actors are clipped against both cameras in the stage's update, not only while drawing (`port_coop_views`; an actor only player 2 saw was clipped out, so it neither moved nor drew in their view, and a map object's model was hidden), and each player has their own area and fast cubes (`TMario::thinkCube` sets them for whoever is `gpMarioOriginal`, so player 2's moves used to overwrite Mario's), a place in either player's being in play (`port_coop_other_cube`, patch `zzzzzz-coop-03`). Things that are the whole stage's stay the first player's: a fall into a pit is theirs alone (the director's hell-dead flag is put back), and the sound's listener is Mario.

**Luigi's colours.** Mario's models share their textures between every load of them, so player 2's body, hands and cap get texture tables of their own (each a block of headers, images and palettes, its offsets positive for the 64-bit build), and the body's main texture is recoloured as multiplayer's Luigi is ([`mp_recolour.h`](../multiplayer/mp_recolour.h)). The body's display lists are made in `loadAfter`, after that; the cap's are made again.

**Camera 2** is a second `CPolarSubCamera` (`TCoopCamera`), made while the stage loads, reading controller 2, following player 2 (it moves right after them). Camera 2 gets its own list of the actors the close-up view can turn to (`setNoticeInfo`, as the director makes camera 1's), or Y read an unmade list. A controller's meanings (`TMarioGamePad::updateMeaning`) follow the camera of the player holding it (`port_coop_pad_camera`, patch `zzzzzz-coop-02`): controller 2 reads as in the close-up view Y opens while camera 2 is in it, not camera 1.

**Two views.** The `drawStage` hook draws the stage itself while both play: the frame's set-up and the goop's textures once; then each view into its part of the frame (`GXPC_SetSplitView`: viewports, scissors, EFB copies and their clears and peeks are moved and scaled into it after the widescreen mapping), with the stage's GX lists, the silhouettes and the 3D part of the GX Post list; then the 2D (the HUD, the screen's effects, the frame's copy) once over both, and a line between the views. The first view is drawn from the entry pass the game makes after each tick, as when alone. For the second, the entry pass (each model's view matrices, the draw buffers) is made again with camera 2 in camera 1's place in the lists; goop is stamped from the first only (`TPollutionManager::stampModel`). The game's view-frustum check (`ViewFrustumClipCheck`) counts what either camera sees as in view, so what either player sees moves and draws in both. Each camera's aspect is its part's (half or twice the game's) while the screen is split.

Patches: [`zzzzzz-coop-01-split-screen`](../../decomp-patches/zzzzzz-coop-01-split-screen.patch) (the hooks, the frustum check, the goop stamp).

## Testing

Headless, with scripted input (`SMS_AUTOPRESS` for player 1) and these test aids:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_JOIN=n` | a second player without a controller joins `n` frames after the stage starts playing |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_PAD=x:y@frame+frames,a@frame+frames,...` | that player's stick (-100..100), or a button (`a@`, `b@`, `x@`, `y@`, `z@`, `l@`, `r@`), frames since they joined |
| `SMS_AUTOCONTROLLER=id:button@field+fields,id:axis=value@field+fields,...` | (platform/pad) a pretend SDL controller's buttons and axes, by SDL number (A 0, B 1, X 2, Y 3, Start 6; axes 0-5), through the same path as a real one: its Start joins as player 2 |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_LEAVE=n` | they leave `n` frames after joining |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_KILL=frame` | they lose a life (frames since the game started) |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_LIVES=n` | the shared lives are set to `n` as they join |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_ONE_UP=n` | a 1-Up `n` frames after they joined |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_COINS=n:count` | from `n` frames after they joined, `count` coins brought out at them, one each 10 frames, for the item group's hit check to take |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_FLUDD=n` | FLUDD put on their back `n` frames after they joined (as a stage that starts without it hands it out) |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_SHINE=n` | the stage's 100-coin Shine brought out `n` frames after they joined, and player 2 put on it 360 frames later (the item group's hit check gives it to them) |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_WARP=frame:area,episode` | the stage changes |
| `SMS_COOP_TEST_AT=x,y,z,angle` | player 2 put there, facing `angle` (0-65535), 10 frames after joining, their camera behind them |
| `SMS_COOP_DEBUG=1` | the stage's lists as found, and both players' places once a second |
